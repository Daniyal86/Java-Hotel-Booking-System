This Java Swing-based hotel booking system provides a user-friendly interface for booking rooms and managing reservations. The application allows users to input booking details such as name, room type, room ID, booking date, check-out date, and bill status. It dynamically calculates the total bill based on room type and stay duration. Users can also view a list of all booked rooms in a tabular format. The UI is enhanced with custom button styles and optional background image support. The project demonstrates core Java concepts like event handling, GUI development, and basic data storage using an ArrayList. This is a simple, beginner-friendly project for learning GUI programming in Java.
